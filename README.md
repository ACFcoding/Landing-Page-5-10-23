# Landing-Page-5-10-23
Homework project to edit existing code to better meet accessibility standards.
Original code was to maintain original functionality as much as possible.
Primary changes were to remove div elements and add alts to images for seo and accessibility reasons. Additional tasks involved maintaining header order and ensuring the code's structure was sound.
